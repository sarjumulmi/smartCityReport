 An Analytics client application delegate can subclass this application delegate
 and the application's Analytics sessions will correspond with the
 application's being in the device's foreground
 (i.e. a session will start when the app moves to the foreground and
 end when the app moves to the background).
 
 NB: Read the comments of any method in this class that the client application delegate class
 overrides, as some subclass methods must call the `super` implementation for this class
 to behave correctly.
 
 NB: Subclasses of this class must "synthesize" the `window` property declared by
 `UIApplicationDelegate` in the subclass implementation:
 
 `@synthesize window;`
