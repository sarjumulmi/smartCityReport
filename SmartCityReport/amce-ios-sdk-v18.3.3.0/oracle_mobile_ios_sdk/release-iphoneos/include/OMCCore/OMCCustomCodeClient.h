/**
 Invoke a custom API HTTP request on the supplied data with a callback
 handler.  If the completion handler is set, it will be invoked
 in the UI (main) thread upon completion of the method invocation,
 allowing update of UI items.  The call assumes any input or expected
 output will be in JSON format.  Given the completion handler, this is
 an asynchronous function.
 
 The completion block will contain the format-specific data for a JSON object,
 namely an NSDictionary or NSArray.  Use the completion block for any
 returned data or errors, HTTP or system.
 
 All of the required OMCe headers, such as Authorization (assuming the user has authenticated)
 and Diagnostics headers will automatically be inserted into the request.
 
 @param function The "function" is the relative part of the URL to invoke
 (everything after "<base URL from the OMC.plist>/mobile/custom/").
 @param method The HTTP method: "PUT", "POST", "GET", "DELETE", "PATCH"
 @param data a JSON object represented as a dictionary or array for the request.
 Note, for a GET call, the data value must be nil, or the iOS HTTP stack will
 incur a network error.
 @param completionHandler the handler called asynchronously on successful or unsuccessful completion.
