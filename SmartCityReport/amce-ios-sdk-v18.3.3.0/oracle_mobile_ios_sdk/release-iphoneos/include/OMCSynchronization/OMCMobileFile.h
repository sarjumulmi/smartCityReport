 @param saveIfOffline If the device is online, this parameter has no effect since any save will be written back to the server. If the device is offline and this option is true, the method will cache updates locally and, when the device returns online, sync them back to the remote service. If the device is offline and this option is false, the save will fail. Note the use of this function overrides any UpdatePolicy setting set elsewhere. This parameter is useful in cases such as a one-off save, where you can set the option to false to ensure the new/updated record is saved to MCS or an error is reported instantaneously, so you can immediately act on the result.
